# Swift wrapper for the Gnu Multi Precision library.

(Very alpha) Work in progress.
Currently this library only exists to provide the functions necessary for my github/NeoTeo/Base58.git library. 
Once that is working I plan to add all remaining functionality.

# Requirements

Currently libgmp.a 6.0.0a is included.
